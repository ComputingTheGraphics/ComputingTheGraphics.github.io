# So You Want to Learn Computer Graphics?
<b> Your how-to guide for general knowledge and hot topics </b>

Just hoping to share a love for learning and an interest in graphics, gaming, vr, animation, and anything to do with the 3D world. If you have comments, feedback, and/or topic ideas - feel free to post an issue!

## Prerequisites:

Though a general understanding of coding is not required, these explanations and tutorials will be in pseudocode and/or C++ with some JavaScript here and there. Additionally, a beginning understanding of linear algebra also helps.
