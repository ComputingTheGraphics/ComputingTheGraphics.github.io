# So You Want to Learn Computer Graphics?

*Your how-to guide for math/algorithmic knowledge and hot topics in graphics, gaming, vr, animation, and more!*

Have comments, feedback, your own article, and/or topic ideas? Checkout the [contributions page](posts/Overview/contributions.md)!

## Prerequisites:

- Though a general understanding of coding is not required, these explanations will be in pseudocode or C++/JavaScript here and there.
- Additionally, a beginning understanding of linear algebra also helps.
- All articles will be written assuming minimal knowledge and will have relevant resources listed at the bottom.
