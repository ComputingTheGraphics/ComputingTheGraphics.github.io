<h3>About the Author</h3>
Hello! I'm Hannah Bollar, the sole curator of this site, and an enthusiast of graphics, rendering, and all things related. For more details, see my <a href="http://hannahbollar.com" target="_blank">personal website</a>.
<br/><br/>
While in school, I loved the interactive aspect of sharing ideas with students and relearning concepts to fully understand them myself. When researching topics for my own learning, though there were some resources online, I found that they were all specific to coding tutorials and certain languages/frameworks; they did not encompass many of the different cross foundational aspects of graphics. This website was created to build an amalgamation of graphics concepts and algorithms to better delve into the topics and why they work as they do.
