		<p>
			Our eyes see the world using specific wavelengths of electromagnetic spectra. The grid of receptors (mainly the retina) at the back of our eyes act as a catch-all, sending specific information to the brain depending on the wavelengths they receive. This complex system of receiving and sending information from the retinas to the brain for comprehension can sense about 30 frames per second of color imagery. With the retinas creating tens of millions of pixels per frame, there is about 1 GB of visual data being processed for each second that passes. To put this into perspective, just watching the movie Toy Story (about 1.5 hours  long) would use about 5400 GB of data (<code>90[min]*60[sec/min]*1[GB/sec] = 5400[GB]</code>), which is almost 54 times as much as the max amount of data listed on the most expensive cell phone packages.

			In computer graphics, light is understood as a binning of wavelengths based on what the human eye can actually perceive. In terms of the overall spectrum, the human eye is limited to just between the  TODO

			In terms of discrepancy between colors, when tested against different hue variations, studies show that individuals begin perceiving small differences between color choices at the <code>7bit</code> level, so to maintain continuity, 8bit is conventionally used ( <code>12bit</code> for professional photo quality, <code>24bit</code> for the extremists and graphic designers who want the 4 million color choices ).

			Physical devices can only produce a subset of these combinations of the complete color space defined by CIE (Commission International de lâ€™Eclairage) due to limitations of machinery, lighting, and ink quality [Figure 1]. These conventional subspaces, CMYK, sRGB, and Hexachrome, are common labelings found on most ink and screen-based devices. All these colors can be boiled down to a linear combination of red green and blue continuous quantities; however, in these limiting spectra defined by the visual CIE space actually available and binned for output, advanced rendering engines are able to still recreate the full visual spectrum by discretizing the space with the bit quantities previously mentioned.
