	<p> TODO - ADD COMIC HERE!!!!!!<br/><br/>
		These programs of artificial life are focused on emergent behavior. Just like real-world organic systems, the resultant behavior is understood as an amalgamation of its parts and their relationships with one another. Some examples from nature include - fire ants creating a bridge, it is not one individual ant in charge telling them to to do so, but instead they begin building as a collective - birds in flight or schools of fish, they move in relation to one another with a general focus for a destination. In sum, it is a focus on systems or the combined small decisions by subsets of the larger group to create a final outcome, instead of clearly defined step-by-step procedures.

		One of the most understood examples in computer graphics is Conway's Game of Life. The game is configured as follows: there are live cells and dead cells all touching in a gridded formation. The user defines an initial state after which they do not interact with the program at all. Every following state organically develops through a set of predefined simple rules:<br/>
		<div class="box">
			<code>Survival</code> - a live cell with 2/3 live neighbors survives to the next round <br/>
			<code>Birth</code> - a dead cell with 3 live neighbors lives in the next round <br/>
			<code>Death</code> - all other cells die in the next round <br/>
		</div>
		These simple rules lead to small behaviors named <code>still lives</code>, <code>oscillators</code>, and <code>spaceships</code>. Minimal versions of them can be seen below...

	Instead of pixel changes like in Conway's Game of Life, this boid implementation developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986 is meant to define boid movements and in doing so simulate the flocking movement and orientation of birds in flight.

	<p>
	Since the execution is defined based on the initial state, the current implementation has a scattered initial distribution of the boid positions (each boid is a particle in the visual). There is also a positional wrapping, so that as the boids continue moving throughout the grid, they are maintained in the same cube of space, making the simulation more interesting.
	<br/><br/>
	In regards to the actual rules defined for the simulation - we have the following three ideas:
	<div class="box">
	    <code>adhesion</code> - a force aiming to push every boid to the center of mass of all boids near it<br/>
	    <code>avoidance/dodging</code> - a force aiming to push every boid away from every other boid near it<br/>
	    <code>cohesion</code> - a force aiming to make each boid have a similar velocity to those near it
