# About:

This is a collection of computer graphics concepts and topics that have been gathered over the years. Whether you're a beginner or someone with experience, I hope that something here will help you.

Though this will not be a tutorial site, there will be github projects and videos linked in some of the posts to better explain certain concepts to you, the reader. If you fork any of the associated github projects, I would love to see your modifications and enhancements.
