# Welcome!

Welcome to ComputingTheGraphics! Your one stop shop for anything and everything computer graphics related.

Want to know how to compute the graphics of anything? You want it, we got it!

# About:

This is a collection of computer graphics concepts and topics that I've gathered over the years. Whether you're a beginner or someone with experience, I hope that something here will help you.

If you have any questions, comments, or corrections regarding what I have written, feel free to contact me.

`If there's a topic you'd like to know more about but isn't available here, let me know!`

Though this will not be a tutorial site, there will be github projects and videos linked in some of the posts to better explain certain concepts to you, the reader. If you fork any of the associated github projects, I would love to see your modifications and enhancements.

Thanks for reading and happy browsing!
