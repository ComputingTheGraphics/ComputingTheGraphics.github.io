How to go more in-detail for a project on your Demo Reel
… add subtitle…
If you're working with a still, you can add layering of the images over a short period to demo how certain changes build up to the final visual.

Additionally, you can add details that better explain the parts of the render you find most important.

If you're demoing a 3d model, a great way to work it is by doing a turn-table build up from the original model adding developments, scenery, and lighting to the final output. Or at least doing a still overlay to build it up instead.

If you worked on a group project, make sure to explain which sub-sections you actually implemented compared to the project as a whole, that way the viewer knows what's the focus. Having group projects are a great way to show of your work in a better light. For example if you're a rigger, animate your work or get an animator (1) to stress test your rig in a demo and (2) to use it in a mini animation.
