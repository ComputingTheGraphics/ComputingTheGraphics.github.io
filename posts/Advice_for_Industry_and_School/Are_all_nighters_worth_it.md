## Are all-nighters worth it?

_Aching steps plod one after the other through the chill of a day not yet warmed by sun. Emptily reaching the apartment door, hands turn the knob away from a slowly awakening world. Feet move to the bed as your body falls with abandon, adrenaline gone, dry eyes closing into dreamless sleep._
We've all been there after an all-nighter, that broken feeling. That single-minded thought of sleep, sleep, sleep. But is it always worth it going through the pain, mental stress, and full out bludgeoning will-power required to do one in the first place? 

#### There's four main scenarios when an all-nighter occurs:
(TURN THIS INTO A FLOW CHART?? OR VENN DIAGRAM)
* (Hard work Scenario) Day after day you've been working on a project extensively, the deadline's coming up and it's still not done so you crank through the night just to meet the submission.
* (Procrastination Scenario) You procrastinated either through other projects or entertainment and now the deadline has come up and you have so much work left to do to meet it.
* (Planned Scenario) You had a lot of deadlines all in a row, and by measuring out what time needed to be done for what, you have to do an all-nighter just to get by.
* (The 'it really didn't need to occur but did scenario) You planned to do an all-nighter because hey, what else is there to do other than work.

main answer - no, never - bad for brain, health, etc - memory capacity
Short answer - no, Long answer - still no but sometimes necessary.

#### EFFECTS

your body can adapt and keep you from feeling the 'tiredness' if you have a hanit of doing all-nighters – but that doesnt mean it's not hurting / you're not dealing with the same effects – just as alcohol intake, you can build up a tolerance and feel like you're fine and handling it, but it's still affecting your liver and body just the same
short term effects  – 
long term effects  – 
when you need to do all nighters - usually means you messed up in planning/ time / preventing yourself from overworking

marathon athlete comparison – cant do marathons every day / days in a row, get ectreme fatigue unless you fully train for it and properly feed and rest yourself

#### Bottom line
Avoid all-nighters at all cost.

If one is absolutely necessary, make sure to take care of yourself. An athlete is only as good as their rest and training routine.

Note: this commentary pertains to all-nighters that are work-based, not entertainment/socializing-based. That is, it focuses on those where 'you're cramming work in overnight because you're meeting some deadline' and not those where 'you didn't try to sleep at a normal hour or you have insomnia'. Have as much fun as you want from dusk-til-dawn but still take care of yourself.
